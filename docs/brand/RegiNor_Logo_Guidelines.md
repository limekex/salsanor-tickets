# RegiNor Logo Guidelines

## Logo Philosophy
The RegiNor logo should communicate **control, calm and professionalism**.
It must never dominate the interface – it supports the system, it does not decorate it.

- Color: Primary text color (`#0F172A`) on light background

### Monochrome

🚫 Never use gradients, shadows, outlines or effects.
